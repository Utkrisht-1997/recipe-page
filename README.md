## Overview

This is my first React Project on my own. So please ignore any rookie mistakes

### The Challenge

Challenge is to make it compatible with mobile version, which I have yet to do. Maybe in future I can come and improve on it.  
Update :- I have modified CSS styling to make it responsive
